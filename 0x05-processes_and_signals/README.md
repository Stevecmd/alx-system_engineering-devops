# Tasks
0. What is my PID
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.


File: `0-what-is-my-pid`

1. List your processes 

Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

- Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
- Display in a user-oriented format
- Show process hierarchy






File: `1-list_your_processes`

2. Show your Bash PID
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use `pgrep`
- The third line of your script must be `# shellcheck disable=SC2009`








File: `2-show_your_bash_pid`

3. Show your Bash PID made easy 
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash`.

Requirements:

- You cannot use `ps`






Here we can see that:

- For the first iteration: `bash` PID is `4404` and that the `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` script PID is `4555`
- For the second iteration: `bash` PID is `4404` and that the `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` script PID is `4557`

File: `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`

4. To infinity and beyond 
Write a Bash script that displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely.

Requirements:

- In between each iteration of the loop, add a `sleep 2`







File: `4-to_infinity_and_beyond`

5. Don't stop me now! 

We stopped our `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.

Requirements:

- You must use `kill`

Terminal #0











File: `5-dont_stop_me_now`

6. Stop me if you can
Write a Bash script that stops `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use `kill` or `killall`






File: `6-stop_me_if_you_can`

7. Highlander

Write a Bash script that displays:

- `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely
- With a `sleep 2` in between each iteration
- `I am invincible!!!` when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal

Make a copy of your `6-stop_me_if_you_can` script, name it `67-stop_me_if_you_can`, that kills the `7-highlander` process instead of the `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` one.





File: `7-highlander`

8. Beheaded process
Write a Bash script that kills the process `7-highlander`.

















File: `8-beheaded_process`
